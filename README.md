Data scientist is a profession that is tasked with collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data to become useful information that can help make decisions in an organization.

Usually, a data scientist needs several tools to help complete their tasks more quickly and efficiently. One of the most commonly used tools is Python. Python is a programming language that allows us to analyze data, visualize, build machine learning models, and automate tasks. This is because Python has a lot of libraries that are very suitable for the work of a data scientist.

Therefore, in starting my career as a data scientist, I started by learning Python and working on a program. The function of this program is to provide information to students based on the inputted grades.

Goals:
1. Manual input by the user
2. Data Type Reading (Name, NIM, Grade)
3. Use of if-elif-else to determine the caption
4. Output in the form of captions

Insights:
1. The data type of Name and NIM is string (str), while Grade is integer (int).
2. The output given will vary according to the value entered.
3. If the grade entered is a number that ranges from 0 to 100, then the output is a description in the form of alphabet letters. However, if the grade entered is a letter or the grade is greater than 100, the output is "Nilai tidak valid" (In English: "Invalid value").
